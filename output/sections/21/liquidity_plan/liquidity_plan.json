      "Having an emergency fund is crucial for financial stability, especially in unforeseen circumstances such as medical emergencies, job loss, or unexpected expenses. Currently, your liquidity status is insufficient, with no coverage for any months. It is recommended to have a minimum of 6 months' worth of expenses saved as an emergency fund to ensure financial security.",
      "Building an emergency fund requires disciplined saving and strategic planning. Start by assessing your monthly expenses, including rent, utilities, groceries, and other essential costs. Aim to save at least 20% of your monthly income towards this fund until you reach the recommended coverage."
