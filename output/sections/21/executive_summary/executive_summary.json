      "The financial assessment reveals significant areas for improvement, particularly in cashflow management and liquidity. With a low surplus and unclear cashflow status, enhancing these areas is crucial for achieving financial stability. Additionally, the absence of savings, insurance, and an emergency fund highlights the need for immediate action to secure financial health.",
      "Investment strategies should focus on reducing equity exposure to align with a conservative risk profile, while debt management should prioritize the repayment of high-interest obligations. Tax optimization can be achieved through strategic investments in ELSS and NPS, offering both tax benefits and potential growth."
