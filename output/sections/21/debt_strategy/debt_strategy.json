      "Given your current financial situation, you have no existing EMIs, which is excellent for maintaining a healthy debt-to-income ratio. This provides you with a strong foundation to manage any future debts effectively. It is crucial to keep your EMIs below 30-40% of your income to ensure financial flexibility and avoid unnecessary stress.",
      "In case you acquire any debts in the future, prioritize them based on interest rates. Start with credit card debts, which typically have the highest interest rates ranging from 18-42%. Next, focus on personal loans with interest rates between 12-20%. Car loans, with interest rates of 8-12%, should be your third priority. Lastly, home loans, which usually have the lowest interest rates of 7-9%, should be the least of your concerns in terms of urgency."

    "actions": [
      "Since your current EMI is Rs.0, there is no need for prepayment at this time.",

      "Focus on paying off any high-interest debts first if they arise, starting with credit card balances."
