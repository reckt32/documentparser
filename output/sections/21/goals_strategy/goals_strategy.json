NEVER use dollars ($) or any other currency. Your role is to provide HONEST and PRACTICAL advice. CRITICAL: The sum of ALL recommended SIPs MUST NOT exceed the available budget. You MUST use the 'affordable_sip' values from the data, NOT the 'ideal_sip' values. The ideal_sip is only for showing what would be needed in a perfect scenario - it is NOT the recommendation. Goals are pre-sorted by priority (priority_rank=1 is highest priority). If there's a gap (gap_exists=true), provide specific bridge recommendations.",

      "The financial strategy is structured to ensure that all priorities are addressed effectively. With a monthly surplus of Rs.53,842, the first allocation is Rs.2,917 towards health insurance to cover a gap of Rs.1,000,000. This leaves Rs.50,925 available for goal investments, which fully meets the current goal requirements. The absence of dependents means term insurance is not required at this time.",
      "Given the conservative risk category, the calculations assume expected returns between 7.4% and 14% per annum, with an inflation rate of 6.0%. This conservative approach ensures that the investment strategy remains aligned with the client's risk tolerance while aiming for optimal growth.",
      "Since there are no existing gaps in the goal funding, the focus remains on maintaining the current strategy. If any future goals arise or if there are changes in financial circumstances, adjustments can be made to either extend timelines, reduce targets, or increase savings rates to accommodate new priorities."
