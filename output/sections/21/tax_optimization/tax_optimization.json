      "Given your current tax profile, you are likely under the new tax regime, which does not allow for traditional deductions. However, you can still optimize your tax liability through strategic investments and capital gains management. By utilizing gain harvesting, you can book up to ₹125,000 in long-term capital gains tax-free this year. This involves redeeming equity mutual funds showing gains and reinvesting to reset the cost base.",
      "While the new regime limits deduction opportunities, focusing on tax-efficient investment products can enhance your post-tax returns. Consider investing in ELSS for both tax savings and equity market exposure, and PPF for assured returns. Additionally, contributing up to ₹50,000 to NPS Tier-1 can provide further tax benefits under Section 80CCD(1B). For health coverage, evaluate top-up or super top-up policies to ensure comprehensive protection and potential tax savings under Section 80D."
