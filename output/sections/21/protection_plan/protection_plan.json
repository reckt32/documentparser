      "To ensure financial security and peace of mind, it is crucial to address the existing protection gaps. Given the current life insurance gap of Rs.6,461,050, it is recommended to secure a term insurance policy with a cover amount of Rs.6,461,050. This will provide a safety net for your dependents in the event of unforeseen circumstances. The estimated annual premium for this coverage is approximately Rs.45,227, though this may vary based on factors such as age and health.",
      "In addition to life insurance, it is vital to have adequate health insurance coverage. Currently, there is no health insurance in place, which poses a significant risk. It is advisable to opt for a family floater health insurance plan with a coverage amount between Rs.10-15 lakh. This will help cover medical expenses and protect against financial strain due to health emergencies. If your current health cover is below Rs.5 lakh, it is flagged as a critical gap that needs immediate attention."
