      "As a conservative investor, your current equity exposure is higher than recommended. To align with your risk profile, it's crucial to reduce your equity holdings. This will help mitigate potential risks and stabilize your portfolio. The recommended equity allocation for you is 32%, which is within the safe range of 25-40%.",
      "To achieve this, consider reallocating funds from small and mid-cap equities to more stable investment options. Short-duration debt funds and corporate bond funds are suitable alternatives that offer lower risk and steady returns. Additionally, liquid funds can be a strategic choice for any near-term liquidity needs.",
      "For diversification, consider allocating 5-10% of your portfolio to international equities through US/global index funds. This can provide exposure to global markets and reduce domestic market dependency. Similarly, investing 5-10% in gold via sovereign gold bonds or gold ETFs can act as a hedge against market volatility."
