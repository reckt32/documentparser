      "Your current financial situation is healthy, with no existing EMIs. This provides you with a great opportunity to manage any future debts effectively. The key to maintaining this healthy status is to prioritize paying off high-interest debts first, should they arise.",
      "If you acquire any debts, focus on clearing credit card debt first, as it typically carries the highest interest rates ranging from 18-42%. Next, tackle personal loans with interest rates between 12-20%. Car loans, with interest rates of 8-12%, should be your third priority. Lastly, home loans, which usually have the lowest interest rates of 7-9%, should be the lowest priority.",
      "Since your current EMI is 0%, there is no need for prepayment at this time. However, if you take on new debt and your EMI exceeds 30% of your income, consider making prepayments to reduce the burden, focusing on the highest-interest debt first."

      "Avoid taking on new unsecured debt until your EMI remains below 30% of your income."
