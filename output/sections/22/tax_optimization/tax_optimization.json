      "Given your current tax profile, you are likely operating under the new tax regime, which does not allow for traditional deductions. However, you can still optimize your tax liability through strategic financial planning. One significant opportunity is to leverage the LTCG exemption limit by booking gains up to ₹125,000 tax-free. This involves redeeming equity mutual funds that have appreciated and reinvesting them to reset the cost base, effectively utilizing the tax-free limit.",
      "While the new regime limits deduction opportunities, consider post-tax optimization strategies. Investing in tax-efficient products such as ELSS, PPF, and NPS can still be beneficial for long-term financial planning, even if they don't offer immediate tax deductions. Additionally, ensure you have adequate health insurance coverage, which can indirectly support financial stability by reducing unexpected medical expenses."
