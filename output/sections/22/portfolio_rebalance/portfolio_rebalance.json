      "As a conservative investor, your current equity exposure is higher than the recommended range. To align with your risk profile, it is advisable to reduce your equity allocation by approximately 17.5% of your total portfolio. This can be achieved by booking profits in small and mid-cap equities and reallocating those funds into safer debt instruments such as short-duration debt funds or corporate bond funds. For liquidity and near-term needs, consider moving a portion of your portfolio into liquid funds.",
      "To maintain a balanced portfolio, you may also consider diversifying into international equities and gold. Allocating 5-10% of your portfolio to international equity through US or global index funds can provide exposure to global markets and reduce domestic market risk. Additionally, investing 5-10% in gold through sovereign gold bonds or gold ETFs can act as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations.",
      "For future equity investments, focus on large-cap index funds or flexi-cap funds, which offer a more stable growth potential suitable for conservative investors. Implementing a systematic investment plan (SIP) can help in gradually increasing your equity exposure while managing risk. Hybrid equity-debt funds can also be considered for their balanced approach, offering moderate risk and potential for steady returns."
