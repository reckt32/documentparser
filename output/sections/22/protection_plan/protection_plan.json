      "To ensure financial security and peace of mind, it is crucial to address the existing insurance gaps. With no current life insurance coverage, there is a significant gap of Rs.6,461,050. It is recommended to secure a term insurance policy that covers this amount. This will provide financial protection for your dependents in the event of unforeseen circumstances. The estimated annual premium for such a policy is around Rs.45,227, though this may vary based on factors such as age and health.",
      "In addition to life insurance, it is imperative to establish a robust health insurance plan. Currently, there is no health insurance coverage, which poses a critical risk. A family floater plan with a coverage of Rs.10-15 lakh is recommended to safeguard against medical emergencies. This will ensure that you and your family have access to necessary healthcare without financial strain."
