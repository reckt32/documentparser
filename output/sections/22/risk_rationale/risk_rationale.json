      "Your risk profile is categorized as Conservative.",

    "paragraphs": [
      "As a Conservative investor, you prefer to minimize risk and preserve your capital. This means you are more comfortable with investments that offer stability and lower volatility, even if it means potentially lower returns.",
      "Based on your risk profile, it is recommended that you allocate between 25% and 40% of your investments in equities. Equities, or stocks, can offer growth over time, but they also come with higher risk. By keeping your equity allocation within this range, you can balance the potential for growth with your preference for safety.",
      "The suggested mid-point for your equity allocation is 32.5%. This balanced approach allows you to participate in market growth while still maintaining a conservative stance. The rest of your portfolio can be allocated to more stable investments like bonds or fixed deposits, which provide regular income and lower risk.",
      "Your investment tenure, which supports some growth, indicates that you have the time to recover from short-term market fluctuations. This allows for a slightly higher equity allocation within your conservative profile, giving you the opportunity to benefit from long-term growth."
