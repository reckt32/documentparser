      "The financial assessment reveals several areas requiring immediate attention. The cashflow status is unclear due to missing data, and the surplus is categorized as low, indicating limited savings potential. It is crucial to maintain EMIs below 30-40% of income and prioritize paying off high-interest debts to ensure financial stability. The current saving rate is 0%, which is significantly below the 20% benchmark, and there is a critical gap in insurance coverage with Rs.0 in life and health insurance, against a requirement of Rs.64.6 lakh and Rs.10-15 lakh respectively.",
      "The investment portfolio requires rebalancing as the current equity allocation of 50% exceeds the recommended range of 25-40% for a conservative risk profile. A reduction of approximately 17.5% in equity holdings is advised, with a shift towards safer debt instruments and diversification into international equities and gold. Additionally, the liquidity plan is insufficient, with no emergency fund coverage, highlighting the need for a robust financial strategy to enhance overall financial health and security."
