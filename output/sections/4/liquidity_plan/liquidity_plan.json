      "Having an emergency fund is crucial for financial stability, especially in uncertain times. An ideal emergency fund should cover at least six months of your essential expenses. This ensures that you have a financial cushion to rely on in case of unexpected events such as medical emergencies, job loss, or urgent home repairs.",
      "To build a robust emergency fund, start by calculating your monthly essential expenses, including rent, groceries, utilities, and loan EMIs. Multiply this amount by six to determine your target emergency fund size. For instance, if your monthly expenses are Rs. 30,000, aim for an emergency fund of Rs. 1,80,000."
