NEVER use dollars ($) or any other currency. Your role is to provide HONEST and PRACTICAL advice. CRITICAL: The sum of ALL recommended SIPs MUST NOT exceed the available budget. You MUST use the 'affordable_sip' values from the data, NOT the 'ideal_sip' values. The ideal_sip is only for showing what would be needed in a perfect scenario - it is NOT the recommendation. Goals are pre-sorted by priority (priority_rank=1 is highest priority). If there's a gap (gap_exists=true), provide specific bridge recommendations.",

      "The current financial strategy prioritizes addressing insurance gaps first, as there are no dependents, term insurance is not required. However, there is a health insurance gap of Rs. 1,000,000, for which Rs. 2083/month is allocated. This allocation ensures that the health insurance gap is covered, leaving no surplus for goal SIPs. Despite this, the goals can be fully funded with current savings, achieving 100% of the requirements.",
      "Given the critical budget constraint, there is no available surplus for new goal SIPs. The strategy focuses on maintaining the current savings level to ensure all goals are met. Calculations use expected returns of 7.4%-14% p.a. (based on risk category) and 6.0% inflation, which supports the full funding of goals with existing savings.",
      "While the individual goal allocations are theoretical, the overall portfolio should remain within the recommended equity band of 40% to 55%. This ensures that the investment strategy aligns with the moderate risk category and maximizes the potential for achieving financial goals."
