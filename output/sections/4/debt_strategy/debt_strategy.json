      "With an annual income of Rs. 384,033 and no current EMIs, you are in a healthy financial position. This is an excellent opportunity to strategically manage any future debts and ensure financial stability. The key is to prioritize high-interest debts and keep your EMI commitments within a safe range.",
      "If you acquire any debts, focus on clearing credit card debts first due to their high-interest rates, which can range from 18% to 42%. Next, tackle personal loans, which typically have interest rates between 12% and 20%. Car loans should be your third priority, with interest rates usually between 8% and 12%. Home loans, with the lowest interest rates of 7% to 9%, should be your last priority.",
      "Since your current EMI is 0% of your income, you have the flexibility to manage future debts efficiently. Always aim to keep your EMI below 30% of your income, which translates to a maximum of Rs. 9,601 per month. This will ensure that you have enough financial bandwidth to handle unexpected expenses and maintain a healthy savings rate."
