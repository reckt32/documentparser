      "Given your current financial situation and the absence of dependents, it is crucial to address the significant life insurance gap of Rs.38,40,330. A term insurance policy with this coverage amount is recommended to ensure financial security in unforeseen circumstances. The estimated annual premium for this coverage is approximately Rs.19,202, though this may vary based on specific health conditions and the insurer's terms.",
      "Additionally, it is imperative to establish a robust health insurance plan. With no current health cover, a family floater policy ranging from Rs.10 to Rs.15 lakh is advisable to safeguard against medical emergencies and hospitalization costs. This will provide a comprehensive safety net, ensuring that healthcare expenses do not become a financial burden."
