      "Given your moderate risk profile, it's crucial to rebalance your portfolio to align with the recommended equity allocation. Currently, your portfolio is entirely invested in equity, which exposes you to higher volatility and risk. The goal is to reduce this exposure and introduce more stability through debt instruments.",
      "To achieve this, consider moving a significant portion of your equity investments into short-duration debt funds or corporate bond funds. These options provide relatively stable returns and lower risk compared to equities. Additionally, liquid funds can be a suitable choice for any near-term financial needs, offering quick access to your money.",
      "For the equity portion that remains, focus on large-cap index funds or flexi-cap funds to maintain growth potential while managing risk. Implementing a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) can help in gradually deploying funds into these categories, ensuring a disciplined investment approach.",
      "Diversification is also key. Allocating 5-10% of your portfolio to international equities through US/global index funds can provide exposure to global markets and reduce domestic market risk. Similarly, consider investing 5-10% in gold via sovereign gold bonds or gold ETFs to hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations."
