NEVER use dollars ($) or any other currency. Your role is to provide HONEST and PRACTICAL advice. CRITICAL: The sum of ALL recommended SIPs MUST NOT exceed the available budget. You MUST use the 'affordable_sip' values from the data, NOT the 'ideal_sip' values. The ideal_sip is only for showing what would be needed in a perfect scenario - it is NOT the recommendation. Goals are pre-sorted by priority (priority_rank=1 is highest priority). If there's a gap (gap_exists=true), provide specific bridge recommendations.",

      "Given the current financial constraints, the primary focus is on addressing the insurance needs. With Rs.2,917/month allocated for health insurance, there is no surplus available for goal SIPs. The Emergency Fund is fully funded with the existing allocation, ensuring immediate liquidity needs are met.",
      "The priority framework emphasizes the importance of insurance coverage, especially health insurance, due to the existing gap of Rs.1,000,000. This allocation ensures that critical health coverage is partially addressed, while the Emergency Fund remains stable. Calculations use expected returns of 7.4%-14% p.a. (based on risk category) and 6.0% inflation.",
      "To achieve full funding for future goals, consider strategies such as extending timelines, reducing target amounts, or increasing income. Although the current allocation meets 100% of the immediate goal requirements, any future surplus should be directed towards building a robust financial plan that aligns with the recommended equity band of 25-40%."
