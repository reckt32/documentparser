      "Current EMI is Rs.590/month, which is 82.7% of your income.",

      "Your current debt situation is causing significant financial stress, as your monthly EMI payments are consuming a large portion of your income. To alleviate this stress, it's crucial to prioritize your debts and make strategic prepayments. By focusing on high-interest debts first, you can reduce your overall interest burden and gradually bring your EMI payments to a more manageable level.",
      "Given your current financial situation, it's essential to avoid taking on any new unsecured debt until your EMI payments are reduced to below 30% of your income. This will help you regain financial stability and improve your overall financial health."
    ],
    "actions": [
      "Identify and list all your debts, starting with credit card debt, followed by personal loans, car loans, and finally home loans.",
      "Make a monthly prepayment of Rs.376 towards your highest-interest debt, which is likely your credit card debt. This will help reduce the principal amount faster and lower the interest charged.",
      "Continue making regular EMI payments while focusing additional prepayments on the highest-interest debt until it is fully paid off.",
      "Once your credit card debt is cleared, redirect the Rs.376 prepayment towards the next highest-interest debt, such as personal loans, and continue this strategy until all high-interest debts are paid off."
