      "As a conservative investor, it's crucial to align your portfolio with your risk tolerance. Currently, your equity exposure is significantly higher than recommended. To mitigate risk and stabilize returns, a reduction in equity holdings is necessary. This can be achieved by reallocating funds from high-risk equity categories to more stable debt instruments.",
      "To effectively reduce your equity exposure, consider booking profits in small and mid-cap equities and shifting these funds into short-duration debt funds or corporate bond funds. These categories offer lower volatility and more predictable returns, aligning well with a conservative strategy.",
      "For liquidity and near-term financial needs, liquid funds are a suitable option. They provide easy access to your money while offering modest returns.",
      "Diversification is key to managing risk. Allocating 5-10% of your portfolio to international equities through US/global index funds can provide exposure to global markets and reduce domestic market dependency. Additionally, investing 5-10% in gold via sovereign gold bonds or gold ETFs can act as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations."
