      "The financial assessment indicates a negative cashflow and a high EMI burden, which is unsustainable and requires immediate attention. The absence of an emergency fund and inadequate insurance coverage further exacerbate financial vulnerability. Prioritizing debt reduction, establishing an emergency fund, and securing necessary insurance coverage are crucial steps towards financial stability.",
      "A conservative risk profile suggests reducing equity exposure to align with the recommended 25-40% range. This rebalancing will help mitigate risk and align with long-term financial goals. Implementing these strategies will enhance financial health and provide a more secure financial future."
