      "To ensure financial security for you and your dependents, it is crucial to address the existing gaps in your protection plan. Currently, there is a significant gap in life insurance coverage, with no existing policy in place. It is recommended to secure a term insurance policy with a coverage amount of Rs.85,588. This will provide a safety net for your dependents in the event of unforeseen circumstances. The estimated premium for such a policy is approximately Rs.599 per year, though this may vary based on factors such as age and health.",
      "In addition to life insurance, it is vital to have adequate health insurance coverage. With no current health insurance, it is recommended to opt for a family floater plan with a coverage amount between Rs.10 lakh and Rs.15 lakh. This will ensure that medical expenses do not become a financial burden. If your current health coverage is less than Rs.5 lakh, it is considered a critical gap that needs immediate attention."
