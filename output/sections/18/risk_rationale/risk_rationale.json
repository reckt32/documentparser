      "Based on your risk profile, you are classified as a Conservative investor. This means you prefer to minimize risk and are more comfortable with stable and secure investments. Your investment strategy focuses on preserving your capital while aiming for modest growth.",
      "Given your Conservative risk appetite, it is recommended that you allocate between 25% and 40% of your investments in equities. Equities can offer growth potential, but they also come with higher risk. By keeping your equity allocation within this range, you can balance the potential for growth with your comfort level for risk.",
      "A mid-point equity allocation of 32.5% is suggested for you. This allocation aims to provide a reasonable balance between risk and return, aligning with your preference for stability while still allowing for some growth potential.",
      "Your investment tenure supports a Growth category, indicating that you have a longer time horizon to invest. This allows for some flexibility in taking on equity exposure, but your overall strategy remains Conservative to ensure your comfort with risk is maintained."
