      "The cashflow waterfall begins with a total gross inflow of Rs. 923,043. From this, mandatory outflows such as loans, taxes, and essential bills amount to Rs. 467,598.7. After covering living expenses of Rs. 200,000, and allocating Rs. 100,000 towards investments, you are left with a net available amount of Rs. 155,444.3.",
      "The net available amount of Rs. 155,444.3 is a healthy surplus, allowing for strategic financial planning. Without specific allocation priorities provided, it is advisable to first ensure that you have an emergency fund covering at least six months of expenses. Following this, assess any insurance gaps and consider prepaying high-interest debts. Finally, allocate funds towards achieving your financial goals, such as retirement or education."
