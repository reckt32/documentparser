      "To achieve a balanced portfolio, it's crucial to reduce the current equity exposure by approximately 50%. This can be done by booking profits from small and mid-cap equities and reallocating those funds into debt instruments. Short-duration debt funds and corporate bond funds are suitable options for this transition, offering stability and lower risk compared to equities.",
      "For liquidity and near-term financial needs, consider moving a portion of your portfolio into liquid funds. These funds provide quick access to cash while offering modest returns.",
      "To maintain a diversified investment approach, allocate 5-10% of your portfolio to international equities through US/global index funds. This will provide exposure to global markets and reduce reliance on domestic equities.",
      "Additionally, consider investing 5-10% in gold through sovereign gold bonds or gold ETFs. Gold acts as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations, adding another layer of diversification to your portfolio."
