      "Current EMI is Rs.0/month, which is 0.0% of your annual income.",
      "Maintain EMI payments below 30-40% of your income to ensure financial stability.",
      "Prioritize paying off debts in the following order: Credit card debt, Personal loans, Car loans, and Home loans.",
      "No current EMI burden allows for strategic planning of future debt management."

    "paragraphs": [
      "With no current EMI obligations, you have a significant opportunity to strategically manage any future debts. It is crucial to keep your EMI payments within 30-40% of your income, which translates to a maximum of Rs.12,801 to Rs.17,068 per month based on your annual income of Rs.384,033. This will help maintain financial flexibility and reduce stress associated with debt repayment.",
      "In the event of acquiring new debts, prioritize paying off high-interest debts first. Credit card debts, which can have interest rates ranging from 18% to 42%, should be your top priority. Follow this with personal loans, which typically have interest rates between 12% and 20%. Car loans and home loans should be addressed subsequently, as they generally have lower interest rates.",
      "Since your current EMI is Rs.0, there is no need for immediate prepayment strategies. However, should you take on new debts, ensure that you focus any prepayment efforts on the highest-interest debt to minimize overall interest costs."
    ],
    "actions": [
      "Monitor your debt levels to ensure they remain manageable and within the recommended EMI percentage of your income.",
      "If you acquire new debts, prioritize paying off credit card debts first, followed by personal loans, car loans, and home loans.",
      "Avoid taking on new unsecured debt until your EMI is comfortably below 30% of your income."
