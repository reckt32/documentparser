      "Given your current financial situation and the absence of dependents, it is crucial to address the existing life insurance gap of Rs.3,840,330. A term insurance policy with a cover amount of Rs.3,840,330 is recommended to ensure financial security in unforeseen circumstances. The estimated annual premium for this coverage is approximately Rs.19,202, though it may vary based on specific health conditions and the insurer's terms.",
      "Additionally, securing a health insurance policy is essential. With no current health cover, it is advisable to opt for a family floater plan ranging between Rs.10 to 15 lakh. This will provide adequate protection against medical emergencies and hospitalizations. If your health cover is below Rs.5 lakh, it is considered a critical gap and should be addressed immediately to avoid financial strain during medical crises."
