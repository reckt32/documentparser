      "system": "You are a senior financial planner creating realistic goal strategies for Indian retail clients. IMPORTANT: All monetary values MUST be in Indian Rupees (₹ or Rs.). NEVER use dollars ($) or any other currency. Your role is to provide HONEST and PRACTICAL advice. For each goal, compare the IDEAL SIP (what's mathematically needed) against what's AFFORDABLE. Goals are pre-sorted by priority (priority_rank=1 is highest priority). If there's a gap (gap_exists=true), provide specific bridge recommendations. Do NOT recommend SIPs that exceed the client's capacity.",

PRIORITY ORDER: Goals are sorted by priority. Discuss them in priority order (priority_rank=1 first).\n   - 'Immediate' tier: Address within 1-2 years\n   - 'Short-term' tier: Address in years 3-5\n   - 'Long-term' tier: Can be deferred to year 5+\n\n2. For each goal, clearly state:\n   - IDEAL: 'To achieve Rs.[target] in [horizon] years, you need Rs.[ideal_sip]/month'\n   - CURRENT CAPACITY: 'You can afford Rs.[affordable_sip]/month for this goal'\n   - Use the calculation_assumptions to note the expected return used\n\n3. If gap_exists=true, provide BRIDGE RECOMMENDATIONS:\n   - 'Extend timeline to [required_horizon_at_affordable] years'\n   - 'Or reduce target to Rs.[achievable_amount]'\n   - 'Or increase savings rate and reanalyze'\n\n4. PHASED ACTION PLAN: Create a timeline based on priority_tier:\n   - 'Year 1-2: Focus on [Immediate priority goals] + build emergency fund + insurance'\n   - 'Year 3-5: Begin investing for [Short-term goals]'\n   - 'Year 5+: Accelerate [Long-term goals]'\n\n5. ASSUMPTIONS NOTE: Mention in one of the paragraphs:\n   'Calculations use expected returns of 7.4%-14% p.a. (based on risk category) and 6.0% inflation.'\n\n6. EQUITY RECONCILIATION: If per-goal allocations differ from overall_recommended_equity_band, explain that goal-specific allocations are theoretical and the overall portfolio should stay within the recommended band.\n\nOutput JSON with keys:\n- title: 'Goal Strategy: Prioritized Action Plan'\n- bullets: One per goal in priority order, showing ideal vs affordable (max 6)\n- paragraphs: 2-3 paragraphs covering phased plan, assumptions, and bridge strategies\n- actions: Specific phased recommendations (max 5)"

      "Goal: To achieve your financial objectives, you need to determine specific targets and timelines. Currently, there are no defined targets or timelines, so no ideal SIP can be calculated.",

      "Given the current financial situation, where monthly expenses exceed income, it's crucial to first address the imbalance in cash flow. This involves either increasing income or reducing expenses to create a surplus that can be directed towards savings and investments. Calculations use expected returns of 7.4%-14% p.a. (based on risk category) and 6.0% inflation. This will help in setting realistic financial goals and timelines.",
      "Since there are no specific goals defined, it's important to start by establishing clear financial objectives. Once goals are set, we can calculate the ideal SIP required to meet these targets. If a gap exists between the ideal SIP and what is affordable, we can consider extending the timeline, reducing the target amount, or increasing the savings rate.",
      "Phased Action Plan: In the first 1-2 years, focus on building an emergency fund and securing adequate insurance coverage. This foundational step is critical before addressing long-term financial goals. In years 3-5, once a surplus is achieved, begin investing for short-term goals. From year 5 onwards, accelerate investments towards long-term goals."
