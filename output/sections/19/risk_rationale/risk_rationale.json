      "Your risk appetite is categorized as Conservative.",
      "The recommended equity allocation for you is between 25% and 40%.",

    ],
    "paragraphs": [
      "As a Conservative investor, your primary focus is on preserving your capital while seeking modest growth. This means you are more comfortable with lower risk and prefer investments that offer stability and security. Your risk profile indicates that you are cautious about market fluctuations and prefer to avoid significant losses, even if it means accepting lower returns.",
      "Based on your risk profile, we recommend allocating between 25% and 40% of your investments in equities. Equities can offer growth potential, but they also come with higher risk. By keeping your equity allocation within this range, you can benefit from potential growth while maintaining a level of risk that aligns with your comfort zone.",
      "The suggested mid-point equity allocation of 32.5% strikes a balance between seeking growth and preserving your capital. This allocation allows you to participate in market gains while minimizing exposure to volatility. The remaining portion of your portfolio can be allocated to more stable investments, such as bonds or fixed deposits, which provide steady returns and reduce overall risk.",
      "Your investment tenure indicates that you have some room for growth, which means you can afford to take a slightly higher risk than a purely conservative approach. However, it is important to regularly review your portfolio and adjust your allocations as needed to ensure they continue to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance."
