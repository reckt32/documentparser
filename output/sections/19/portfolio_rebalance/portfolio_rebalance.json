      "Current equity allocation is at 50%, which exceeds the recommended range of 25-40%.",
      "Target equity allocation is 32%, requiring a reduction of approximately 17.5% in equity holdings.",

      "Given your conservative risk profile, it is crucial to align your portfolio with a more stable and less volatile asset mix. Currently, your equity exposure is significantly higher than recommended, which may expose you to unnecessary market risks. By reducing your equity allocation to the target of 32%, you can achieve a more balanced and risk-averse portfolio.",
      "To reduce equity exposure, consider booking profits in small and mid-cap equities and reallocating these funds into short-duration debt funds or corporate bond funds. These instruments offer lower risk and can provide more predictable returns, aligning with your conservative strategy.",
      "For liquidity and near-term financial needs, liquid funds are a suitable option. They offer quick access to funds while maintaining a low-risk profile.",
      "In terms of diversification, allocating 5-10% of your portfolio to international equities through US or global index funds can provide exposure to global markets and reduce domestic market dependency. Additionally, investing 5-10% in gold through sovereign gold bonds or gold ETFs can act as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations."
