      "The financial health assessment indicates a low savings rate and insufficient insurance coverage, with an emergency fund that covers 0.0 months. To enhance financial stability, it is crucial to maintain EMIs below 30-40% of income and prioritize paying off high-interest debts, particularly credit card debt. Addressing the life insurance gap of Rs.6,461,050 should be a priority, followed by securing adequate health insurance coverage.",
      "The current equity allocation of 50% exceeds the recommended range for a conservative risk profile. A reduction to 32% is advised, focusing on reallocating from small and mid-cap equities to safer debt instruments. Additionally, tax optimization strategies such as investing in ELSS, NPS Tier-1, and health insurance top-ups can maximize savings and provide potential returns."
