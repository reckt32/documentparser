      "As you currently have no life insurance coverage, it is crucial to address this gap to ensure financial security for your dependents in the event of unforeseen circumstances. A term insurance policy with a coverage amount of Rs.6,461,050 is recommended. This will provide a safety net equivalent to approximately ten times your annual income, which is a standard benchmark for adequate life insurance coverage. The estimated annual premium for such a policy is around Rs.45,227, though this may vary based on factors such as age, health, and specific insurer policies.",
      "In addition to life insurance, it is important to secure adequate health insurance coverage. Currently, you have no health insurance, which poses a significant risk. A family floater health insurance plan with a coverage amount of Rs.10-15 lakh is recommended to protect against high medical expenses. If your current health coverage is less than Rs.5 lakh, it is considered a critical gap that needs immediate attention. Prioritizing life insurance is essential if you have dependents, followed by securing health insurance to ensure comprehensive protection."
