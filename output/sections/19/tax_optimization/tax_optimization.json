      "Given your current tax profile, you are likely operating under the new tax regime, which does not allow for traditional deductions. However, there are still strategic moves you can make to optimize your tax situation. By focusing on capital gains harvesting, you can take advantage of the ₹125,000 exemption limit for long-term capital gains. This involves redeeming equity mutual funds that have appreciated and then reinvesting them to reset the cost base, effectively making gains tax-free.",
      "For future planning, consider the benefits of the old regime if your circumstances change, as it allows for deductions under sections like 80C, 80CCD, and 80D. Investing in ELSS, PPF, or NPS can provide significant tax savings while also contributing to your financial goals. Additionally, enhancing your health insurance coverage with a top-up policy can offer both financial security and tax benefits under section 80D."
