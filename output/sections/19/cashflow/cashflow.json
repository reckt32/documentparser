      "Understanding your cashflow is crucial for effective financial management. Cashflow refers to the movement of money in and out of your accounts. A 'Low' surplus band indicates that your savings after expenses are minimal, which can be risky in case of emergencies or unexpected expenses.",

      "Identify non-essential expenses that can be reduced or eliminated. For example, consider cooking at home more often instead of dining out.",
      "Set a monthly savings goal. Aim to save at least 20% of your income, if possible. Automate this process by setting up a recurring transfer to a savings account.",
      "Review your cashflow regularly, at least once a month, to ensure you are on track with your financial goals."
