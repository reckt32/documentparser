NEVER use dollars ($) or any other currency. Your role is to provide HONEST and PRACTICAL advice. CRITICAL: The sum of ALL recommended SIPs MUST NOT exceed the available budget. You MUST use the 'affordable_sip' values from the data, NOT the 'ideal_sip' values. The ideal_sip is only for showing what would be needed in a perfect scenario - it is NOT the recommendation. Goals are pre-sorted by priority (priority_rank=1 is highest priority). If there's a gap (gap_exists=true), provide specific bridge recommendations.",

      "The priority framework ensures that your financial resources are allocated efficiently. With a monthly surplus of Rs.53,842, Rs.2,917 is allocated to cover the health insurance gap, leaving Rs.50,925 for goal funding. This allocation fully meets the current goal requirements, achieving 100% funding. Calculations use expected returns of 7.4%-14% p.a. (based on risk category) and 6.0% inflation.",
      "Since there are no specific goals listed, the entire remaining budget of Rs.50,925 is available for future goal SIPs. This ensures flexibility and readiness to address any immediate, short-term, or long-term financial objectives as they arise. The recommended equity band for your overall portfolio is between 25% and 40%, ensuring a conservative approach to risk management.",
      "In the absence of specific goals, it is crucial to maintain a disciplined savings approach. Should any funding gaps arise in the future, consider extending timelines, reducing target amounts, or increasing savings rates to bridge these gaps. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your financial plan will help maintain alignment with your long-term objectives."
