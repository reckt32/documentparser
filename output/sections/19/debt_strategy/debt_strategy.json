      "With a healthy debt stress level and no current EMIs, you are in a strong position to manage any future debts effectively. It's crucial to maintain this healthy financial status by keeping any future EMIs below 30% of your annual income, which is Rs.646,105. This means your monthly EMIs should ideally not exceed Rs.16,152.",
      "In the event that you acquire new debts, prioritize them based on interest rates. Start with credit card debt, which typically carries the highest interest rates ranging from 18% to 42%. Next, focus on personal loans with interest rates between 12% and 20%. Car loans should follow, with rates from 8% to 12%, and finally, home loans, which generally have the lowest interest rates of 7% to 9%.",
      "If your EMI payments ever exceed 30% of your income, consider making prepayments to reduce the principal amount of the highest-interest debt first. This strategy will help you save on interest payments over time and reduce your overall debt burden."

      "In case of high EMI burdens, focus on prepaying the highest-interest debt to reduce financial stress."
