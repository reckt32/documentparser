      "Given the current overexposure to equity at 100%, it is crucial to rebalance the portfolio to align with a moderate risk profile. The recommended equity allocation is between 40% and 55%, with a target of 48%. This requires a reduction in equity exposure by approximately 52.5% of the portfolio.",
      "To achieve this, consider moving a significant portion of the equity investments into short-duration debt funds or corporate bond funds. These options provide stability and lower risk compared to equities. Additionally, liquid funds can be considered for any near-term liquidity needs.",
      "For the equity portion that remains, focus on large-cap index funds or flexi-cap funds to maintain growth potential while managing risk. Implementing a systematic investment plan (SIP) can help in gradually deploying funds into these categories.",
      "Diversification is also key. Allocating 5-10% of the portfolio to international equities through US/global index funds can provide exposure to global markets. Similarly, investing 5-10% in gold via sovereign gold bonds or gold ETFs can act as a hedge against market volatility."
