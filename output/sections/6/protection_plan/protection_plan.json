      "Given your current status of being underinsured, it is crucial to address the life insurance gap immediately. With a dependent relying on your income, securing a term insurance policy with a cover of Rs. 38,40,330 is essential. This will ensure financial stability for your dependent in the event of unforeseen circumstances. The estimated annual premium for this coverage is approximately Rs. 19,202, though it may vary based on specific health conditions and the insurer's terms.",
      "In addition to life insurance, establishing a robust health insurance plan is vital. Currently, with no health cover in place, it is recommended to opt for a family floater plan ranging from Rs. 10 to 15 lakh. This will provide adequate protection against medical emergencies and hospitalization expenses, which can otherwise lead to significant financial strain."
