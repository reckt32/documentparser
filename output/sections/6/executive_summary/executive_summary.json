      "The financial assessment reveals a net cashflow surplus of ₹454,665.3, indicating a healthy financial position with adequate savings. However, liquidity is currently insufficient, covering only 5.13 months, and should be increased to over 6 months. The debt strategy is sound with no current EMIs, but it is crucial to maintain EMIs below 30-40% of income for stability and focus on paying off high-interest debts first.",
      "The portfolio requires rebalancing as the current 100% equity allocation exceeds the recommended range for a moderate risk profile. A target equity allocation of 48% is advised to align with a balanced risk approach. Additionally, there is a significant insurance gap of ₹33.4 lakh, necessitating a comprehensive protection plan. Tax optimization strategies could yield savings of ₹13,750 by maximizing deductions and capital gains harvesting."
