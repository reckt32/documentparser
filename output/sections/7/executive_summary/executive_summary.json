      "The financial health overview indicates a strong cashflow position with a net surplus of ₹454,665.30. However, the client is underinsured by ₹38.4 lakh and lacks an emergency fund, highlighting the need for improved liquidity and protection strategies. Current debt levels are manageable with no EMIs, but maintaining EMIs below 30-40% of income is advised for future stability.",
      "Investment strategies should focus on rebalancing the portfolio from a high equity concentration of 100% to a more balanced 48% to align with a moderate risk profile. Tax optimization can yield savings of ₹13,750 by utilizing deductions under Sections 80C, 80CCD(1B), and 80D. Addressing these areas will enhance financial resilience and growth potential."
