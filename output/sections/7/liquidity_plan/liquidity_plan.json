      "Having an emergency fund is crucial for financial stability, especially in uncertain times. It acts as a financial cushion that can support you during unexpected events such as job loss, medical emergencies, or urgent repairs. The recommended practice is to have enough savings to cover at least six months of your essential expenses.",
      "Your current liquidity status indicates that you have no funds set aside for emergencies. This situation can leave you vulnerable to financial stress in case of unforeseen circumstances. It's important to start building your emergency fund immediately to ensure peace of mind and financial security."

    "actions": [
      "Calculate your monthly essential expenses, including rent, utilities, groceries, and loan EMIs.",
      "Set a realistic monthly savings goal to gradually build your emergency fund. Aim to save at least 10-20% of your income.",
      "Open a dedicated savings account for your emergency fund to avoid using it for non-emergencies.",
      "Automate your savings by setting up a monthly transfer to your emergency fund account.",
      "Review and adjust your budget to identify areas where you can cut back and increase your savings rate.",
      "Consider additional income sources, such as freelance work or part-time jobs, to accelerate your savings."
