      "Your current portfolio is heavily skewed towards equity, which is not aligned with your moderate risk profile. To achieve a balanced portfolio, it is essential to reduce your equity exposure and introduce debt instruments. This will help in mitigating risk and ensuring more stable returns.",
      "To reduce equity exposure, consider booking profits in small and mid-cap equities and reallocating those funds into short-duration debt funds or corporate bond funds. These options provide relatively stable returns and lower risk compared to equities.",
      "For liquidity and near-term financial needs, liquid funds are a suitable choice. They offer quick access to funds while providing better returns than traditional savings accounts.",
      "To maintain some equity exposure, focus on large-cap index funds or flexi-cap funds, which offer diversification and potential for growth. Implementing a systematic investment plan (SIP) can help in gradually building this exposure while managing market volatility.",
      "For additional diversification, consider allocating 5-10% of your portfolio to international equities through US or global index funds. This can provide exposure to global markets and reduce reliance on domestic market performance.",
      "Additionally, incorporating 5-10% of your portfolio in gold through sovereign gold bonds or gold ETFs can act as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations."
