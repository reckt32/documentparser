      "Based on your risk profile, you have a Moderate appetite for risk. This means you are comfortable with some level of risk in your investments, but you prefer a balanced approach that avoids extreme fluctuations. Your investment strategy should reflect this by maintaining a mix of assets that can provide growth while managing risk.",
      "The recommended equity allocation for your portfolio is between 40% and 55%. This range allows you to benefit from the potential growth of equities while keeping your risk exposure in check. A midpoint allocation of 47.5% in equities is suggested to strike a balance between risk and return.",
      "Your investment tenure supports a Growth strategy, which means you have the time horizon to potentially benefit from the higher returns associated with equities. However, it's important to maintain a diversified portfolio that includes other asset classes to mitigate risk and ensure stability."
