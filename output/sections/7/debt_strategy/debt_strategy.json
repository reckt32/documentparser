      "Current EMI is Rs.0/month, which is 0.0% of your annual income.",

      "With a current EMI of Rs.0, you have a healthy financial standing. It's crucial to maintain this by keeping any future EMIs below 30% of your income, which translates to a maximum of approximately Rs.9,600 per month. This will help you manage your finances comfortably without undue stress.",
      "When considering debt repayment, always prioritize high-interest debts. Start with credit card debts, which typically have the highest interest rates ranging from 18% to 42%. If you have any, focus on clearing these first. Next, tackle personal loans with interest rates between 12% and 20%. Car loans, with interest rates from 8% to 12%, should be your third priority. Lastly, home loans, which usually have the lowest interest rates of 7% to 9%, should be your last priority for repayment.",
      "Since your current EMI is Rs.0, there is no immediate need for prepayment. However, if you take on new debt, ensure that your total EMI does not exceed Rs.9,600. If it does, consider making prepayments to reduce the principal on the highest-interest debt first."

    "actions": [
      "Monitor your debt levels and ensure any new debt keeps your EMI below Rs.9,600.",
      "If you acquire credit card debt, aim to pay it off as soon as possible to avoid high interest charges.",
      "Avoid taking on new unsecured debt until your EMI is comfortably below 30% of your income."
