      "Given your current life insurance gap of Rs.3,840,330, it is crucial to secure a term insurance policy that provides adequate financial protection. This coverage will ensure that in the event of an unforeseen circumstance, your financial obligations are met, and your dependents, if any, are safeguarded. The estimated annual premium for this coverage is approximately Rs.19,202, although this may vary based on factors such as age, health status, and the insurer's terms.",
      "Your current health insurance coverage of Rs.5 lakh is insufficient for comprehensive protection against medical emergencies. It is advisable to enhance your health insurance to a Rs.10-15 lakh family floater plan. This will provide a more robust safety net, covering a wider range of medical expenses and reducing the financial burden in case of hospitalization or critical illness."
