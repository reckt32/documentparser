      "To ensure financial security and peace of mind, it is crucial to address the existing gaps in both life and health insurance coverage. With no current life insurance, there is a significant gap of Rs.6,461,050. It is recommended to secure a term insurance policy with this coverage amount to protect against unforeseen circumstances. The estimated annual premium for such a policy is approximately Rs.45,227, though this may vary based on factors such as age and health status.",
      "In addition to life insurance, there is a critical need for health insurance coverage. Currently, there is no health insurance in place, which poses a significant risk. It is advisable to obtain a family floater health insurance policy with a coverage amount between Rs.10 lakh to Rs.15 lakh. This will provide adequate protection against medical emergencies and ensure that healthcare costs do not become a financial burden."
