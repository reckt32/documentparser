      "Having a robust liquidity plan is crucial for financial stability, especially in times of uncertainty. Currently, your liquidity status is insufficient, covering 0 months of expenses. To safeguard against unexpected financial challenges, it is advisable to aim for a liquidity coverage of at least 6 months. This means having enough readily accessible funds to cover your essential expenses for half a year without relying on income.",
      "Building an emergency fund requires discipline and strategic planning. Start by assessing your monthly expenses, including rent, utilities, groceries, and any other essential costs. Multiply this total by six to determine your target emergency fund amount. This fund should be easily accessible, preferably in a savings account or a liquid mutual fund, to ensure you can access it quickly when needed."
