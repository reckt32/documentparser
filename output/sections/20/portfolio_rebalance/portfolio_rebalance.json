      "Current equity allocation is at 50%, which exceeds the recommended range of 25-40% for a conservative risk profile.",
      "Target equity allocation is 32%, requiring a reduction of approximately 17.5% in equity holdings.",

    "paragraphs": [
      "As a conservative investor, it's crucial to align your portfolio with your risk tolerance. Currently, your equity exposure is significantly higher than the recommended range. To mitigate risk and stabilize returns, a reduction in equity holdings is advised. This can be achieved by booking profits in small and mid-cap equities and reallocating those funds into more stable debt instruments.",
      "Consider reallocating the excess equity into short-duration debt funds or corporate bond funds, which offer lower risk and more predictable returns. For any near-term liquidity needs, liquid funds can be a suitable option. These adjustments will help in maintaining a balanced portfolio that aligns with your conservative risk profile.",
      "To ensure diversification and hedge against market volatility, consider allocating 5-10% of your portfolio to international equities through US or global index funds. Additionally, a 5-10% allocation to gold via sovereign gold bonds or gold ETFs can provide a safety net against inflation and currency fluctuations."
