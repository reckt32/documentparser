      "Currently, you have no existing EMIs, which is an excellent position to be in. This allows you to have more disposable income and flexibility in managing your finances. It's important to maintain this status by avoiding unnecessary debt and ensuring any future debt is managed efficiently.",
      "In the event that you take on new debt, prioritize paying off high-interest debts first. Credit card debts, which can have interest rates ranging from 18% to 42%, should be your top priority. Personal loans, with interest rates between 12% and 20%, should be the next focus. Car loans and home loans, with lower interest rates, can be managed with regular payments unless you have surplus funds for prepayment.",
      "To maintain financial health, ensure that any new EMIs do not exceed 30% of your monthly income, which would be approximately Rs.16,153 based on your annual income of Rs.646,105. This will help you avoid financial stress and maintain a comfortable lifestyle."

    "actions": [

      "If you acquire new debt, prioritize prepayments towards the highest-interest debt first, especially if your EMI approaches or exceeds 30% of your income.",
      "Regularly review your financial situation to ensure you remain within the healthy debt stress level."
