Consider investing in ELSS under Section 80C, which offers tax benefits and potential equity growth. Additionally, contributing an extra ₹50,000 to the NPS Tier-1 account under Section 80CCD(1B) can provide further tax relief.",

This not only provides financial security but also offers tax benefits. Furthermore, take advantage of the LTCG exemption by redeeming equity mutual funds to book gains up to ₹125,000 tax-free, then reinvest to reset your cost base."
