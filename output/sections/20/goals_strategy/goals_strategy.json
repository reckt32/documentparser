NEVER use dollars ($) or any other currency. Your role is to provide HONEST and PRACTICAL advice. CRITICAL: The sum of ALL recommended SIPs MUST NOT exceed the available budget. You MUST use the 'affordable_sip' values from the data, NOT the 'ideal_sip' values. The ideal_sip is only for showing what would be needed in a perfect scenario - it is NOT the recommendation. Goals are pre-sorted by priority (priority_rank=1 is highest priority). If there's a gap (gap_exists=true), provide specific bridge recommendations.",

With a monthly surplus of Rs.53,842, Rs.2,917 is allocated to cover the health insurance gap, leaving Rs.50,925 available for goal funding. This allocation meets 100% of the current goal requirements, ensuring that your financial objectives are on track.",
