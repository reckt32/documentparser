      "The financial health assessment indicates a need for significant improvements in cashflow management, savings, and insurance coverage. Current liquidity is insufficient, with no emergency fund, and the saving rate is below the benchmark. Immediate action is required to establish a robust emergency fund and enhance insurance coverage to Rs. 64.6 lakh for life and Rs. 10-15 lakh for health.",

Tax optimization can be achieved through strategic investments in ELSS and NPS, while maintaining a debt-free status ensures financial flexibility."
